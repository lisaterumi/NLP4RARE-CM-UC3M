Bowen Hutterite syndrome is a rare genetic disorder that is apparent at birth (congenital). The disorder is characterized by growth delays before birth (intrauterine growth retardation); failure to grow and gain weight at the expected rate (failure to thrive) during infancy; malformations of the head and facial (craniofacial) area, resulting in a distinctive appearance; and other physical abnormalities. These may include restricted joint movements, abnormal deviation (clinodactyly) or permanent flexion (camptodactyly) of the fifth fingers, foot deformities, and/or undescended testes (cryptorchidism) in affected males. Some affected infants may also have kidney (renal), brain, and/or other malformations. Bowen Hutterite syndrome is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait. Bowen Hutterite syndrome appears to affect males and females in equal numbers. Since the disorder was originally described in two brothers in 1976 (P. Bowen), over 20 cases have been reported in the medical literature.  Most affected individuals are Hutterites.  The Hutterites are members of a religious sect (Anabaptists) originally from Moravia who live communally in certain regions of the United States (e.g., Montana, North and South Dakota) and Alberta, Canada.
