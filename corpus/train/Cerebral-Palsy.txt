Cerebral Palsy is a neurological movement disorder characterized by the lack of muscle control and impairment in the coordination of movements. This disorder is usually a result of injury to the brain during early development in the uterus, at birth, or in the first two years of life. Cerebral Palsy is not progressive. Cerebral Palsy is a relatively rare disorder that affects males and females in equal numbers.  The United Cerebral Palsy Association estimates that between 1 in 1000 and 3 in 1000 infants develop Cerebral Palsy each year in the United States.  There are approximately 9000 new cases of this disorder reported each year.
