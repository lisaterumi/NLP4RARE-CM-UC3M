"Adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC) is a relatively rare form of cancer that most commonly develops in the salivary glands or other regions of the head and neck. ACC can occur in other parts of the body, such as the breast, skin, cervix in females, prostate gland in males, and various other areas. ACC tumors are characterized by a distinctive histological pattern of abnormal ""nests"" or cords of certain cells (epithelial cells) that surround and/or infiltrate ducts or glandular structures within the affected organ. These structures are typically filled with a mucous-like material or contain abnormal fibrous membranes. Such characteristics are apparent during microscopic evaluation of tumor cells from a biopsy sample. ACC is considered a low-grade malignancy that has a history of slow growth. Rarely, ACC can be aggressively invasive and infiltrate nearby lymph nodes as well as the ""sheaths"" or coatings surrounding nerve fibers (perineural spaces). This form of cancer may have a tendency to recur later at the site where it first developed (local recurrence) and in approximately 50% of patients, ACC spreads to distant bodily sites, particularly the lungs (metastatic disease), potentially resulting in life-threatening complications. ACC typically occurs during adulthood, around the ages of 40 to 60, but has also been diagnosed in children and adolescents."
