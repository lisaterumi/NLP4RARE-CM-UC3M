Cerebellar agenesis appears to affect males and females in equal numbers. The exact incidence and prevalence of the disorder in the general population is unknown. Congenital isolated cerebellar agenesis is considered an extremely rare occurrence. After birth (postnatally) the definite diagnosis of cerebellar agenesis is based on the neuroimaging findings with MRI (magnetic resonance imaging); it cannot be made on clinical grounds. Before birth (prenatally) the diagnosis of cerebellar agenesis is not reliably possible, by ultrasound or fetal MRI. Babies are on record with normal brain ultrasound at 20-25 weeks of gestation, with subsequent destruction of the cerebellum during later stages of pregnancy.
