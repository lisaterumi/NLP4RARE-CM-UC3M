Apraxia is a neurological disorder characterized by the inability to perform learned (familiar) movements on command, even though the command is understood and there is a willingness to perform the movement. Both the desire and the capacity to move are present but the person simply cannot execute the act. There is little data available on the incidence of apraxia.  Since apraxia may accompany dementia or stroke, it is more frequently diagnosed among older persons.
