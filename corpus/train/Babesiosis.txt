The diagnosis of babesiosis is made based upon a thorough clinical evaluation, a detailed patient history (e.g., recent tick bite), characteristic findings, and specialized tests such as the examination of blood smears that screen for the parasite inside red blood cells (erythrocytes). The diagnosis may also be confirmed by antibody testing (indirect immunofluorescent assay).
