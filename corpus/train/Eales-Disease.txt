Eales Disease is a rare disorder of sight that appears as an inflammation and white haze around the outercoat of the veins in the retina. The disorder is most prevalent among young males and normally affects both eyes. Usually, vision is suddenly blurred because the clear jelly that fills the eyeball behind the lens of the eye seeps out (vitreous hemorrhaging). The exact case of Eales Disease is not known.  This disorder seems to occur spontaneously because no precipitating factors such as injury, infection, or heredity appear to be involved. Eales Disease is a rare disorder that affect males and females in equal numbers.
