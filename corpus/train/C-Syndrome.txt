"C syndrome, also known as Opitz trigonocephaly syndrome, is a rare disorder transmitted as a result of ""gonadal mosaicism"". Mosaicism refers to a condition in which a person has cells that differ from each other in genetic makeup. The difference is usually a variation in the number of chromosomes. Normally, all body cells would have 46 chromosomes, but in mosaicism, some cells may have 45 or 47. Mosaicism occurs as a result of an error in cell division very early in fetal development. Only about 70 cases have been reported in the worldâ€™s medical literature.  C syndrome is a very rare disorder that seems to affect males and females in equal numbers."
