Psoriatic, Arthritis is a rheumatoid-like arthritic condition characterized by pain and swelling (inflammation) of the joints (arthritis) that occurs in association with gray discoloration or scaly plaques of the skin (psoriasis). Abnormalities of the nails may also be present. In many cases, skin symptoms precede the development of arthritis by several years. The exact cause of the psoriatic arthritis is unknown. Depending upon the medical literature, of the many Americans who have psoriasis, anywhere from five to 40 percent develop psoriatic arthritis. It is more common in women and usually first appears between the ages of 20 and 50 years, but onset can occur at any age.
