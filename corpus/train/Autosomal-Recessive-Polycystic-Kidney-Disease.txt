ARPKD affects males and females in equal numbers. The incidence of ARPKD is estimated to occur in approximately 1 in 20,000 individuals in the general population. Because some people may go undiagnosed, it is difficult to determine the true frequency of ARPKD is the general population. Although most patients are diagnosed in utero or at birth, mild cases may not become apparent until adolescence or adulthood. ARPKD can affect individuals of any ethnic group.
