APL comprises 5 to 10% of all cases of adult acute myeloid leukemia. Each year in the United States, it develops in around 2.2 people per million, for a total of 600 to 800 individuals. Although APL can occur at any age, middle age adults are most commonly affected; the median age at diagnosis is around 40. Epidemiological studies have shown that APL is slightly more common in Hispanics and slightly less common in African Americans compared to other ethnic groups. In very rare cases, APL can occur after chemotherapy or radiation therapy for other cancers, especially when therapy involves a class of medication known as topoisomerase II inhibitors; this is called therapy-related APL.
