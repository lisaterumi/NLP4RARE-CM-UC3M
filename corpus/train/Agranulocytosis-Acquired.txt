Acquired agranulocytosis is a rare, drug-induced blood disorder that is characterized by a severe reduction in the number of white blood cells (granulocytes) in the circulating blood. The name granulocyte refers to grain-like bodies within the cell. Granulocytes include basophils, eosinophils, and neutrophils. Acquired Agranulocytosis is a rare blood disorder that affects males and females in equal numbers.  People who are taking certain medications such as cancer drugs, alkylating agents, anti-thyroid drugs, dibenzepin compounds, or other drugs can be at risk for this disorder. The diagnosis of acquired agranulocytosis is made by combining a thorough history with tests to confirm abnormally low levels of granulocytes in the circulating blood. Regular periodic blood testing is required for individuals who take drugs that place them at high risk for acquired agranulocytosis. In some cases (e.g., people who are taking clozapine), blood tests to monitor granulocyte levels are done on a weekly basis.
