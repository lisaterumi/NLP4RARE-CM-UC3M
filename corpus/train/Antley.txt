Antley-Bixler syndrome is a rare genetic disorder that can cause structural changes of the skull, bones of the face and other skeletal abnormalities. The disorder is typically associated with premature closure of joints (cranial sutures) between particular bones of the skull (craniosynostosis). Many affected infants and children also may have a prominent forehead, underdeveloped midfacial regions (midfacial hypoplasia), protruding eyes (proptosis), and low-set ears. This condition has been described in over 30 patients to date. The estimated prevalence for the condition is less than 1 in 1,000,000.
