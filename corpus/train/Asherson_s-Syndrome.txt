"Asherson's syndrome is an extremely rare autoimmune disorder characterized by the development, over a period of hours, days or weeks, of rapidly progressive blood clots affecting multiple organ systems of the body. Conditions such as infections, immunizations, wounds caused due to physical trauma and failure in the anticoagulation mechanism of the body usually act as ""triggers"". Approximately 300 individuals have been identified with Ashersonâ€™s syndrome since the disorder was first defined in the medical literature in 1992. More women have been affected than men. The disorder can occur at any age, although most cases have been reported in young adults."
