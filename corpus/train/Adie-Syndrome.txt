Adie syndrome, or Holmes-Adie syndrome, is a rare neurological disorder affecting the pupil of the eye. In most patients the pupil is larger than normal (dilated) and slow to react in response to direct light. Absent or poor tendon reflexes are also associated with this disorder. In most individuals, the cause is unknown (idiopathic), but Adie syndrome can occur as due to other conditions such as trauma, surgery, lack of blood flow (ischemia) or infection. In rare cases localized disturbance of sweat secretion is associated with Adie syndrome (Ross syndrome). Adie syndrome involves a usually non progressive and limited damage to the autonomic nervous system, which is the portion of the nervous system that controls or regulates certain involuntary body functions including the reaction of the pupils to stimuli. Adie syndrome affects females more often than males by a ratio by some estimates of 2.6:1 for cases where the cause is unknown. Young adults usually between the ages of 25 to 45 are most commonly affected. The prevalence of Adieâ€™s pupil (not the full syndrome) is approximately 2 people per 1,000 in the general population. The exact incidence or prevalence of Adie syndrome itself is unknown. In most instances, treatment will not be necessary. Glasses may be prescribed to correct blurred vision; sunglasses can help individuals with sensitivity to light. Therapy using dilute pilocarpine may improve poor depth perception and relieve glare in some patients. The loss of deep tendon reflexes is permanent.
