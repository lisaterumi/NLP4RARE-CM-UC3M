Adult polyglucosan body disease is a rare disorder that appears to affect males and females in equal proportions. Familial clustering is observed in about 30% of cases especially among Ashkenazi Jewish populations. More than 50 cases have been reported in the medical literature. A wide variety of disorders can be mistaken for APBD. Such disorders include multiple sclerosis, hereditary spastic paraplegia, adrenomyeloneuropathy, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, metachromatic leukodystrophy, and Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease. Men with primarily urinary symptoms may be mistaken for having an enlarged prostate (prostate hypertrophy).
