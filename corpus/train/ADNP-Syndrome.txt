ADNP syndrome affects females and males in equal numbers. The exact number of people who have this disorder is unknown. According to one estimate, about 1 in 20,000 people in the general population in the United States and Europe have the disorder. Rare disorders like ADNP syndrome often go misdiagnosed or undiagnosed, making it difficult to determine their true frequency in the general population. ADNP syndrome is believed to account for about .17% of individuals with autism, making it one of the most common, single-gene causes of an autism spectrum disorder. Approximately 205 affected children have been identified worldwide in the medical literature and as reported by the ADNP Kids Research Foundation as of January 2019.
