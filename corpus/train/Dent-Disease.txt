The exact incidence and prevalence of Dent disease is unknown. Dent disease type 1 has been reported in approximately 250 families. Dent disease type 2 has been reported in approximately 25 individuals. Because some affected individuals go undiagnosed or misdiagnosed, determining these disordersâ€™ true frequency in the general population is difficult. Dent disease is fully expressed in males only. Dent disease may be recognized during childhood, while other cases can remain undiagnosed well into adulthood.
