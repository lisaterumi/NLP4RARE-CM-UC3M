Diffuse pulmonary lymphangiomatosis affects males and females in equal numbers. Most cases have been reported infants and children, but the disorder has occurred in adults as well. The disorder has been reported in individuals of every race and ethnicity. The exact incidence or prevalence is unknown. The disorder often goes misdiagnosed or undiagnosed, making it difficult to determine true frequency of diffuse pulmonary lymphangiomatosis in the general population.
