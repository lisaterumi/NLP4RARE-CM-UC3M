Aceruloplasminemia is an extremely rare disorder that affects males and females in equal numbers. The exact incidence of aceruloplasminemia is unknown. It may be more prevalent in Japan, where it is estimated to affect 1 individual per 2,000,000 in the general population. Because many cases of aceruloplasminemia go undiagnosed or misdiagnosed, determining the disorderâ€™s true frequency in the general population is difficult. Aceruloplasminemia was first described in the medical literature in 1992.
