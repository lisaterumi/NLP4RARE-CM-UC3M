Achard-Thiers syndrome is a rare disorder that occurs primarily in postmenopausal women and is characterized by type 2 (insulin-resistant) diabetes mellitus and signs of androgen excess. The exact cause of this syndrome is unknown. These syndromes appear to be transmitted within families.  Approximately 50% of the sisters of women with PCOS have some form of the syndrome.  The exact mechanism of genetic transmission is unknown. Achard-Thiers Syndrome is a rare disorder that affects females after menopause.  The incidence of this disorder in the general population is not known. The diagnosis of Achard-Thiers syndrome should be suspected based on the clinical findings. Because affected women are hyperinsulinemic, a two-hour oral glucose tolerance test shows abnormally elevated levels of glucose in the blood.
