Aplasia Cutis Congenita is a rare disorder with a complicated pattern of inheritance. Babies are born with the absence of certain layer(s) of skin, most often on the scalp, but also on the trunk, and/or arms and legs. The affected area is typically covered with a thin, transparent membrane. The skull and/or underlying areas may be visible and be abnormally developed. Aplasia Cutis Congenita may be the primary disorder or it may occur in association with other underlying disorders. Aplasia Cutis Congenita is a very rare disorder that affects males and females in equal numbers.  At least five hundred cases have been reported in the medical literature.  Absence of skin is obvious at birth (congenital).
