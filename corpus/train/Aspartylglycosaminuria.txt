Major symptoms may include coarse facial features, spine and eye deformities, behavior problems and mental retardation. Aspartylglycosaminuria occurs as a result of deficient activity of a particular enzyme, leading to the accumulation of metabolic products in the body.

Diarrhea and infections that keep reoccurring are noticed. After the first few years facial features begin to get coarse which continues during the following years.  The skeleton may become deformed and the ocular lens may develop crystalline deposits.  Mental deterioration may begin to occur after age five and behavior problems are common.
