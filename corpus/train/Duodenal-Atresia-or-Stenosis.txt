Duodenal atresia or stenosis is a rare congenital digestive disorder that usually occurs for no apparent reason (sporadically). However, a few cases of duodenal atresia have been inherited as an autosomal recessive genetic trait. Duodenal atresia or stenosis is a rare disorder that occurs in approximately 1 of 7,500 live births to 1 of 40,000 live births.  In Finland, the rate goes up to 1 case per 3,400 live births.  Males and females are affected in equal numbers.
