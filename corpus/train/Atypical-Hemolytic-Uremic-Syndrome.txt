E.coli In childhood, aHUS affects males and females in equal numbers. In adulthood, females are affected more often than males, most likely because pregnancy is a triggering event. The exact overall incidence and prevalence is unknown. One study placed the incidence in the United States at 2 individuals per 1 million in the general population. In Europe, the disorder is estimated to affect approximately .11 per 1 million individuals between the ages of 0-18. aHUS accounts for approximately 5-10% of all cases of hemolytic uremic syndrome.
