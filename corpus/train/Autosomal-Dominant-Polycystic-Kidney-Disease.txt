ADPKD affects males and females in equal numbers. Although a head-count has never been done, autopsy records show that between 1 in 400-1,000 people in the general population had ADPKD. There are approximately 6,000 new cases diagnosed each year in the United States. Approximately 6-10 percent of individuals receiving dialysis and renal transplant treatments in the United States have ADPKD. ADPKD is estimated to affect approximately 200,000 to 600,000 in the United States and another 12,000,000 people million worldwide, but only about one-fourth may know they have the disease.
