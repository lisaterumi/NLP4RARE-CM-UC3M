"Acromicric Dysplasia is an extremely rare inherited disorder characterized by abnormally short hands and feet, growth retardation and delayed bone maturation leading to short stature, and mild facial abnormalities. Most cases have occurred randomly for no apparent reason (sporadically). However, autosomal dominant inheritance has not been ruled out. Acromicric Dysplasia is an extremely rare disorder that, in most cases, appears to occur randomly for no apparent reason (sporadically).  However, autosomal dominant inheritance has not been ruled out. Acromicric Dysplasia is an extremely rare disorder that, in theory, affects males and females in equal numbers. Only a very small number of cases have been reported in the medical literature. Acromicric Dysplasia may be diagnosed based upon a thorough clinical evaluation, characteristic physical findings (e.g., abnormally short hands), a detailed patient history, and a variety of specialized tests such as advanced imaging techniques. X-rays may reveal characteristic abnormalities of the bones in the hands and feet (e.g., abnormally short broad phalanges, metacarpals, and metatarsals; epiphyseal coning of the phalanges in the toes; pointing of the last four metacarpals; and the presence of an abnormal notch on the radial side of the 2nd metacarpal and ulnar side of the 5th metacarpal). The removal and study of cartilage cells (biopsy) under a microscope may reveal distinctive abnormalities affecting the growth cartilage. These abnormalities may include disorganization of the ""growing"" portion of certain bones, especially abnormal organization of cells that form cartilage (chondrocytes) and of a protein substance (collagen) that forms fibers within the ligaments, tendons, and connective tissue. In addition, an abnormally high number of such cells may demonstrate degeneration."
