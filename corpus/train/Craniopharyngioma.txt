Craniopharyngiomas occur in around 0.5 to 2 people per million each year and represent around 1.2 to 4% of all intracranial tumors in children. They mostly develop in two age groups (bimodal incidence peaks): children aged 0 to 14 years and adults aged 50 to 74 years. They occur in men and women equally. Adamantinomatous craniopharyngioma are more common, representing 86 to 89% of all craniopharyngiomas.
